I created this app as a part of Udacity scholarship for Android, to improve my skill in XML and Java.

App shows the user list of recent earthquakes, including their magnitude, location and time of the event.

Creating this app improved my knowledge about Android Studio VCS, AsyncTask, Loader, using API, parsing JSON, checking network connection,
making HTTP request and JAVA programming.
